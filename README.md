8:07am - Starting the PHP course videos through Lynda while reading through the current docs at https://www.php.net/manual/en/.
This week I have been trying to implement a wordpress app through thier free service and have been learn the platform. Today is
trying to get an index page for the Journal.

8:27 - Finsished the first three videos of explain php and have taken notes in scrivener. It talks about the basics of the langauge and also has me install a MAMP server, which I'll use to locally run the page. I'm not familiar with this so yet, but I'm going to install MAMP and then continue on with the 'Printing on the Screen' portion. This morning is going to be a lot of Hello World and making sure i've setup things correctly.

8:45 - MAMP is setup, not configured. I've created a PHP file, but Its not print in the DOM correctly. and In the video, the comments syntax is a little different and I'm not sure why; none the less I can make both single and multi line comments. Moving on to Variables.

9:05 - Not sure how to get a browser to open and execute php form just a single php file so I moved to a sandbox, at https://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/ and am now testing with no issue. Working with Variable is simple, just put a bling sign and a descriptive naming convention and call it back later. Consts are a little different. Using the define statement and parens, inside the parens gets two parameters, the first is the name of the const and the second is the value of the const. Also all variable types are familiar. So far On track.

9:30 - Before the arrays, there was a syntax lesson on quotes and double quotes and escape characters. Now onto the arrays.

10:00 - They main takeaway so far are the two types of arrays in php. The associative and the indexable, both being a collection of data that acts like a key value pair. This isn't new, just a different way of framing what I know from JavaScript.

10:25 - Finishing up arrays lessons with some practicing of how to call variables and values, how to add and remove, target and print. There's built in function that allow printing of all elements without building a loop, but loops is a few lessons away. I'm going to refil coffee and food and come back to practice some array manipulation and move into comparison operators.

11:30 - The lesson on comparison and logical operators is done. All of the syntax is the same as js. There is a var_dump function which dumps information about one or more variables. The ternary operators and switch statements are very similar as well.

11:55 - Going to practice some ternary and switch statements in the sandbox.

12:25PM - First thing i'm notcing when really trying things out is i'm forgeting semi-colons. PHP isn't a strictly typed language, but it does require semi-colons which I think makes it a weakly typed language.

12:48PM - Notes while practicing PHP, making comments is a bit different then how I think they work, I've notcied so far they have to be in a <?php ?> wrap, other wise it prints to the DOM. I think this may have to do with the way browsers read php and html in one file. The lessons so  far haven't mention this outright. 2nd is using two quotes instead of one, right now I'm able to call a var within a simple echo string easier if the double quote is used.

1:24 - This lesson was about math in PHP. Its the same sytax as javascript. This lesson was very straight forward. Going to take a break and come back to Loops for real this time.

2:00 - My plan was to start the loops lessons, but before that quickly setup a MAMP server to run the php files locally and also get use to how MAMP works. While walking through a quick server build, I found that MAMP has WordPress platform and software access and is able with the click of a button create a quick PHP site that has the WordPress software I'll need to setup this site. This is neat and now I'm penciling in MAMP as software to learn for this. For my Capstone, I'd still like to build it from scratch so I can understand that process as well. This is just neat.

2:25 - Loops are great. Syntactically different, but none-the-less. I've been doing some more reading about node and php and I can see some of the culture around why might be used against another. Node seems to be so much more flexable and had a big following behind it because it might be newer? I've read about how PHP is getting an update this coming november and will leave a lot of website using it technology behind. I'm thinking about what I have planned and will create the REAMME for said project here shortly. I'm pretty sure I know how I can do what I'm setting out to do.

3:05 - Started a readme for the Proj and don't have a name yet. Have a small outline and am going to be drawing some boards as to how i'd like the look and connection to be.

3:25 - This simple drawing took a few minutes, and I'm not proud of it. I'm not sure how this should look yet because what it feels like im building is just a simple wordpress site. My idea is to encorporate the simple program to help put your fingers to the keys. I didn't want to look at the type of app i'm making so as to not draw 'copied inspiration' but making a simple wordpress site feels empty. Adding to my plan, looking into more CodePens to see what kind of design this could be. I'm also going to add some goals to my README.
