8:07am - Starting the PHP course videos through Lynda while reading through the current docs at https://www.php.net/manual/en/.
This week I have been trying to implement a wordpress app through thier free service and have been learn the platform. Today is
trying to get an index page for the Journal.

8:27 - Finsished the first three videos of explain php and have taken notes in scrivener. It talks about the basics of the langauge and also has me install a MAMP server, which I'll use to locally run the page. I'm not familiar with this so yet, but I'm going to install MAMP and then continue on with the 'Printing on the Screen' portion. This morning is going to be a lot of Hello World and making sure i've setup things correctly.
