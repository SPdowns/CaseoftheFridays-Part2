8:07am - Starting the PHP course videos through Lynda while reading through the current docs at https://www.php.net/manual/en/.
This week I have been trying to implement a wordpress app through thier free service and have been learn the platform. Today is
trying to get an index page for the Journal.

8:27 - Finsished the first three videos of explain php and have taken notes in scrivener. It talks about the basics of the langauge and also has me install a MAMP server, which I'll use to locally run the page. I'm not familiar with this so yet, but I'm going to install MAMP and then continue on with the 'Printing on the Screen' portion. This morning is going to be a lot of Hello World and making sure i've setup things correctly.

8:45 - MAMP is setup, not configured. I've created a PHP file, but Its not print in the DOM correctly. and In the video, the comments syntax is a little different and I'm not sure why; none the less I can make both single and multi line comments. Moving on to Variables.

9:05 - Not sure how to get a browser to open and execute php form just a single php file so I moved to a sandbox, at https://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/ and am now testing with no issue. Working with Variable is simple, just put a bling sign and a descriptive naming convention and call it back later. Consts are a little different. Using the define statement and parens, inside the parens gets two parameters, the first is the name of the const and the second is the value of the const. Also all variable types are familiar. So far On track.

9:30 Before the arrays, there was a syntax lesson on quotes and double quotes and escape characters. Now onto the arrays.
